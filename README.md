Python-based drowsiness detector


# Description
This is the python version capston project from [this project](https://github.com/hdyhlm/Drowsiness-Detection-Java-Trials)

The project is modified from a project that we found useful in dataflair which uploaded by dataflair team. ([click-here](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-driver-drowsiness-detection-system/)).

PS: Model that we used is from the dataflair project too.
